    "# Comparing Models to Predict March Madness Rankings\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "March Madness, also known as the NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament happens annually in the month of March. Depending on which teams performed the best in the season, the top 32 are selected to compete in the tournament and play each other in a bracket for the winners trophy. Although March Madness 2018 is already over, our team wanted to see which model would do a better job at predicting team rankings/winners. We decided to look at the Elo Model as well as use simple logistic regression with features we extracted in order to find a trend. "

Because the scraping usually takes ~10 minutes, the code was run once and put into a csv file, which we later used to do our data analysis. \n"
