    "# Comparing Models to Predict March Madness Rankings\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "March Madness, also known as the NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament happens annually in the month of March. Depending on which teams performed the best in the season, the top 32 are selected to compete in the tournament and play each other in a bracket for the winners trophy. Although March Madness 2018 is already over, our team wanted to see which model would do a better job at predicting team rankings/winners. We decided to look at the Elo Model as well as use logistic regression with features we extracted in order to find a trend. "

    "## The Elo Model \n",

    "The Elo Model is a way of creating a rating system for zero-sum games - games that only have one winner and one loser (e.g. basketball, hockey, football, tennis, etc.) The system uses the following method:\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm works in the following way: \n",
    "\n",
    "Each team begins with the same ranking. The standard across most sports is ~1000-1500. We started out with *1200*, which was a common trend amongst others across the internet who had also used Elo Rankings for other sports. We then calculate the probability of each team winning with the following equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Team1 Probability = (1.0 / (1.0 + 10^((Team1_Rating – Team2_Rating) / 400)))**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Team2 Probability  = (1.0 / (1.0 + 10^((Team2_Rating – Team1_Rating) / 400)))**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see that Team1 Probabilty + Team2 Probabiilty = 1.0. The '400' is a standardized constant in Elo Rankings[(1)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system)\n",
    "\n",
    "When a game is played, we can update the rankings of both teams using the following equation: \n",
    "\n",
    "**Team1_Rating = Team1_Rating + K*(Team1_Score – Team1_Probability)**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Team2_Rating = Team2_Rating + K*(Team2_Score – Team2_Probability)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the scores are determined by the outcome of the game:\n",
    "\n",
    "win = 1.0\n",
    "draw = 0.5\n",
    "loss = 0.0\n",
    "\n",
    "The K factor is a numerical value that \"determines how much the Elo rating should change following a match result\"[(2)](www.betfair.com.au). Across literature and the internet, a common k-factor for basketball has been 20 (Used by FiveThirtyEight and others). We can actually create a K=factor that depeonds on the nubmer of matches played. (More on this later). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The following Elo class creates an Elo ranking for each team and updates it everytime a game is played. It will be used for data analysis on the data we scraped earlier.  "
